mapediting TODO
===============
The mapediting branch is supposed to extend the cube engine possibilities,
by making mapping easier and also maybe improving performances.

Selectable entities
-------------------
 * drag and drop ? or entites displacement controlled with arrow keys ?
 * "clipify" command to clipify all selected unclipped mapmodels
   could generate many little clips (with a max. resolution?)
   or we could make an octree based system idk
 * remove "vector <int> entsels" completely, and use entity::selected only ?
 * currently using the "radius" (xy) for mapmodels; use the bounds instead (x, y) with rotation ?
   (actually, clips should be rotate-able too :/ )
 
Textured clips
------------------
 * the basis is ready (let's try with something entity based).
 * finish the rendering system :
   - walls
   - don't use render_flat: it renders thing line by line, here it should be rectangle-based
     to be more efficient
   - simplify physics check
 * update the entity selection code so as to support TCLIP
    
  
 Textures/Mapmodels Browser
 -----------------
  * Auto generated CFG is messed because of mapmodels (nothing_clip ignored?)  - the rest looks fine.
  * Menus : change the menu code to allow images + checkboxes ? would be better as it would allow to manage 
    additions/removal from the list and insertion in the map from the same menu.
