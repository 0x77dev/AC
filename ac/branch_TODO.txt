mapediting TODO
===============
The mapediting branch is supposed to extend the cube engine possibilities,
by making mapping easier and also maybe improving performances.

Selectable entities
-------------------
 * drag and drop ? or entites displacement controlled with arrow keys ?
 * "clipify" command to clipify all selected unclipped mapmodels
   could generate many little clips (with a max. resolution?)
   or we could make an octree based system idk
 * remove "vector <int> entsels" completely, and use entity::selected only ?
 * currently using the "radius" (xy) for mapmodels; use the bounds instead (x, y) with rotation ?
   (actually, clips should be rotate-able too :/ )
 
Textured clips
------------------
 * should it be based on entities, or should the map format change ?
    - If entity based : the editing part would be more "mapmodel/clip" oriented
    - Else : more integrated to the cube system (would be more complicated ? raycubelos should be changed then ?)
