Selectable entities
-------------------
 * drag and drop ? or entites displacement controlled with arrow keys ?
 * "clipify" command to clipify all selected unclipped mapmodels
 * remove "vector <int> entsels" completely, and use entity::selected only ?
 * currently using the "radius" (xy) for mapmodels; use the bounds instead (x, y) with rotation ?
   (actually, clips should be rotate-able too :/ )
 
 Textured clips
 ------------------
  * import what is already done
  
  Textures/Mapmodels Browser

   * Auto generated CFG ? Select content to insert from a menu
